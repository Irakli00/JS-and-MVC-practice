this is practice in MVC pattern, async js and js DOM manipulations. Not much time spent on css as it wasn't the goal.

features implemented: form taking in users settings, answers always randomized, questions' number indicator follows the game's progression.
to-do: render rules pop-up, previous choice highlighted, questions' number indicator to render respective questions ,warnings on last question, code to be refactored, .

P.S. was first time working with github, didn't know commit messages would be visible :)
